## To verify that apache2 is running as a Service in our OS, use following command

```
sudo systemctl status apache2
```


If it is green and running, then you did everything correctly – you have just launched your first Web Server in the Clouds!

Before we can receive any traffic by our Web Server, we need to open TCP port 80 which is the default port that web browsers use
to access web pages on the Internet

As we know, we have TCP port 22 open by default on our EC2 machine to access it via SSH, so we need to add a rule to EC2 configuration
to open inbound connection through port 80:
Open inbound port 80


Our server is running and we can access it locally and from the Internet (Source 0.0.0.0/0 means ‘from any IP address’).

First, let us try to check how we can access it locally in our Ubuntu shell, run:

```
curl http://localhost:80
